You want to **convert a `.txt` file into a `.asm` file** so that Keil can recognize it as an assembly code file. The good news: this is **simple and doesn’t require “real conversion”**—it’s mostly about changing the file extension and ensuring the content is valid assembly code. Here’s the step-by-step process:

---

### **Method 1: Rename the file extension**

1. Locate your `.txt` file (e.g., `mycode.txt`).
2. Right-click the file → **Rename**.
3. Change the extension from `.txt` to `.asm` (e.g., `mycode.asm`).
4. Windows will prompt:
   *“If you change a file name extension, the file might become unusable. Are you sure?”*
   → Click **Yes**.
5. Now, Keil will recognize it as an assembly file when you add it to your project.

### **Method 2: Save as `.asm` from a text editor**

1. Open the `.txt` file in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, or Notepad++).
2. Go to **File → Save As**.
3. In the “Save as type” dropdown, select **All Files (\*.\*)**.
4. In the **File Name** field, type `mycode.asm`.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Now you have a `.asm` file ready for Keil.

### **Important Notes**

* Ensure the **content of the `.txt` file is valid 8051 assembly code**. Keil will not compile it if the code is incorrect.
* Make sure **no extra characters** like BOM (Byte Order Mark) are added if you are using editors like Notepad.
* If your code uses lowercase mnemonics, Keil usually accepts them, but for consistency, uppercase is preferred (e.g., `MOV A, #0H`).
